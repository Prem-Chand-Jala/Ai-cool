                    <p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) research aims to create AI systems that can answer natural language questions about images. However, traditional VQA methods often provide simplistic responses. This work introduces Visual Question Explanation (VQE) to enhance VQA by providing detailed explanations and facilitating complex interaction with visual content. We developed an MLVQE dataset from a machine learning course, comprising slide images, transcripts, and question-answer pairs. We propose SparrowVQE, a small multimodal model, trained with a three-stage mechanism: multimodal pre-training, instruction tuning, and domain fine-tuning. SparrowVQE, utilizing SigLIP and Phi-MLP models, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmark VQA datasets, demonstrating superior performance and detailed understanding of visual content.</p>

                    <h2>Voice Cloning</h2>
                    <p>proposed Text-to-Speech (TTS) system architecture represents a meticulously designed sequence of components aimed at synthesizing natural and expressive voice from input text. At its core are three major components: the Text Encoder, Mel Spectrogram Encoder, and Voice Cloning Model. The Text Encoder serves as the initial step, translating input text into a robust representation through a series of intricate procedures, including character embeddings, bidirectional GRU processing, and attention mechanisms. Following this, the Mel Spectrogram Encoder generates an encoded representation of the mel spectrogram, capturing crucial acoustic subtleties. Finally, the Voice Cloning Model combines these encoded representations, employing a detailed decoder architecture with RNN layers and attention mechanisms to synthesize speech. </p>
